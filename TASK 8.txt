TASK 8
4/6/25

Objective: Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.
Tools: Free VPN client- Proton VPN.
Key concepts: VPN, encryption, privacy, tunneling protocols, network security.

First, Installed ProtonVPN from internet and connected my computer.
For verification, Googled "https://whatsmyipaddress.com" and it resulted in a wrong ip address.
VPN connection verified!

Googled, "www.example.com" to test the connection and found a padlock button on the top left corner.
This means the connection is encrypted and secure via HTTPS, and the VPN is working alongside it.

Disconnected the vpn and again googled "https://whatsmyipaddress.com" and the result was my correct ip address.

Benefits of VPN:

--> Hides real IP address and location.
--> Encrypts your internet traffic (secure on public Wi-Fi).
--> Bypasses geo-restrictions.
--> Prevents ISP tracking.

Limitations of VPN:

--> Free versions often have limited speed or data.
--> Not all services unblock streaming platforms.
--> May slightly reduce browsing speed.
--> Some free VPNs may log user data.
